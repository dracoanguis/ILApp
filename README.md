# Ivabot - Prototype

This project is a prototype for the Ivabot project, which is a class project for the course of Science Innovation Lab from UNIGE.

The developped idea is a 3d view of a webshopping chatbot, used as a clerk in an online clothe shop.

## How to start

This project is auto-built as a package hosted on github (a docker image) wich can be started and linked to any port on the computer, starting a website on the localhost. The following command can be used:

```bash
 docker run --pull=always  -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/dracoanguis/ilapp:latest
